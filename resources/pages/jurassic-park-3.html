            <p>Dr. Alan Grant (played by Sam Neill), a renowned paleontologist, is tricked into visiting Isla Sorna by Paul and Amanda Kirby (played by William H. Macy and Téa Leoni), a couple looking to find their son, Eric (played by Trevor Morgan), who went missing on the island while paragliding. The Kirbys convince Grant to join them by offering to fund his research.</p> <p>Once on the island, they soon discover that the Kirbys are not what they seem, and their rescue mission quickly turns into a fight for survival. As they explore the island, the group encounters a variety of dinosaurs, including the ferocious Spinosaurus, which becomes a relentless and deadly adversary. Along the way, they also face encounters with Velociraptors and other prehistoric creatures.</p> <p>The group's struggle to survive is further complicated by their efforts to avoid both the dinosaurs and a team of mercenaries sent by the Kirbys, led by a man named Cooper (played by John Diehl). Throughout the film, Dr. Grant must use his expertise to navigate the dangerous terrain, outsmart the dinosaurs, and protect both himself and the Kirbys from becoming extinct. Along the way, he forms a bond with young Eric Kirby, who demonstrates remarkable resourcefulness and knowledge about the island's inhabitants.</p>
