            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p>

<p>InGen Corporation, the genetic engineering company, has successfully created Jurassic World, a fully operational dinosaur theme park, on Isla Nublar. The park is immensely popular, featuring a wide variety of genetically-engineered dinosaurs, including the fearsome Indominus rex, a genetically modified hybrid dinosaur.</p>

<p>Claire Dearing (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) is the operations manager of Jurassic World. She invites her nephews, Zach (played by Nick Robinson) and Gray (played by Ty Simpkins), to the park to spend time with them. However, the park's attendance starts to decline due to the public's desire for more thrilling and awe-inspiring attractions.</p>

<p>To boost attendance, the park's geneticists create the Indominus rex, a highly intelligent and dangerous hybrid dinosaur. When the Indominus rex escapes its enclosure, chaos ensues. Owen Grady (played by Chris Pratt), a skilled Velociraptor trainer, is brought in to help track down the escaped dinosaur.</p>

<p>As Claire, Owen, and the park's staff work together to contain the Indominus rex, they face not only this genetically engineered threat but also the natural instincts of the dinosaurs on the island. The film explores themes of human hubris, the consequences of playing with nature, and the ethical dilemmas surrounding genetic engineering.</p>

<p>It also delves into the bond between humans and dinosaurs, particularly the relationship between Owen and the Velociraptors he trained. As the story unfolds, the characters must confront the monstrous Indominus rex and ensure the safety of the park's visitors, including Claire's nephews, who find themselves in grave danger in the midst of the dinosaur rampage.</p>
