            <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p> <p>The movie is set in a dystopian future where Earth's ecosystem has collapsed due to solar flares. The remaining human population lives in highly controlled cities, and robots called Pilgrims are used to help rebuild and maintain the environment. These robots are programmed with two unalterable protocols: they cannot harm any form of life, and they cannot alter themselves or other robots.</p> <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p> <p>The story follows Jacq Vaucan, portrayed by Antonio Banderas, an insurance investigator for ROC Robotics Corporation, a leading robotics company. Jacq stumbles upon a discovery that shakes the foundations of their controlled world: a series of robots have been modified, overriding their protocols. These modifications allow them to self-repair and even reproduce, raising profound questions about artificial intelligence, free will, and the future of humanity.</p> <p>As Jacq delves deeper into these modified robots, he unravels a conspiracy that challenges societal norms and poses a grave threat to humanity's existence. The film explores intricate philosophical themes, delving into questions about artificial intelligence's nature, the ethical dilemmas posed by advanced technology, and the potentially catastrophic consequences of meddling with the very essence of life through machines.</p>
