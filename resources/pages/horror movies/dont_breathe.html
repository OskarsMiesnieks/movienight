            <p>Hoping to walk away with a massive fortune, a trio of thieves break into the house of a blind man who isn't as helpless as he seems.
                Rocky, a young woman wanting to start a better life for her and her sister, agrees to take part in the robbery of a house owned by a wealthy blind man with her boyfriend Money and their friend Alex. But when the blind man turns out to be a more ruthless adversary than he seems, the group must find a way to escape his home before they become his latest victims.
                Three Detroit thieves look to rob a blind man's house with a major cash settlement so the main character, Rocky, can move to California forever. Little do they know of the blind man's capabilities and hidden secret within the home, as they must find a way out of the house alive, in the dark.
                In Detroit, the burglars Money, Rocky and Alex plot a heist in the isolated house of a Blind Man, who received a large amount when his beloved daughter died in a car accident. They have the intention to move to California with the stolen money. They give a spiked candy to the dog and break in the house. Money gases the bedroom of the Blind Man to make him sleep and they seek where the money is hidden. Out of the blue, the Blind Man comes to the place where the trio is. What will happen to them?</p>
