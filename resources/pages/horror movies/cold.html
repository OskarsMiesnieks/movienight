            <p>It's 1976 and two young journalists Melissa & David, who are fresh out of college and looking for fast fame and notoriety decide they have found their very first "BIG STORY"... They decide for their very first "professional story in journalism" they should investigate a strange case of cattle mutilations on the French-Swiss border. Melissa & David have even gotten a camera that records live footage, which the two are hoping to use to film their entire journey. They would also like to film the interviews with the locals so that they can get their first-hand accounts, testimonials and any other information the residents in the area, may have regarding the cattle mutilations. Melissa & David are very excited to be able to record their entire project. The two have plans to present the full story to a local television channel to get started on their way to fame, fortune & success. But things don't go quite as planned, starting with the fact that the entire scientific team they were supposed to be meeting has suddenly, somehow, gone missing. Melissa & David then decide they have to go and find the team of missing Scientists. They enlist the help of an expert in first-aid, an American Forensic Investigator and a British Biologist to escort them deep into the mountains to aid in the search for the missing Scientists. Things don't go quite as planned and their original story idea takes a surprising turn and it may not be for the best.</p>
