            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p> <p>John Hammond invites a group of experts, including paleontologists Dr. Alan Grant (played by Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Sattler (played by Laura Dern), along with mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum), to visit his newly developed theme park, Jurassic Park. The park is home to genetically recreated dinosaurs, brought back to life through advanced cloning techniques.</p> <p>However, when a series of technical glitches and security failures occur, the park's visitors find themselves in a life-threatening situation. The situation worsens when the park's main computer system is sabotaged by Dennis Nedry (played by Wayne Knight), a disgruntled employee attempting to steal dinosaur embryos for a rival company.</p> <p>As chaos ensues and the dinosaurs roam freely, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler, Hammond's grandchildren, and the rest of the group must navigate the island, evade the dangerous dinosaurs, and find a way to escape. Along the way, they face various challenges, including the highly intelligent Velociraptors and the enormous and deadly Tyrannosaurus rex.</p>
