            <p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong></p> <p>Four years after the incident at Jurassic Park, a new island, Isla Sorna, is revealed as the original breeding ground for the cloned dinosaurs. John Hammond (played by Richard Attenborough), the creator of Jurassic Park, sends a team of scientists and specialists, including Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum), to study the dinosaurs in their natural habitat before a company named InGen, led by Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow (played by Arliss Howard), arrives to exploit the creatures for profit.</p> <p>Malcolm's team arrives on the island and discovers that not only are the dinosaurs flourishing, but they are also facing threats from both the island's harsh environment and poachers hired by InGen. The expedition becomes a fight for survival as the team tries to navigate the dangerous terrain, avoid the dinosaurs, and escape the island before they fall victim to the ancient creatures.</p> <p>Complicating matters, the team finds out that Ludlow's group has captured several dinosaurs and plans to transport them to the mainland for a new Jurassic Park attraction. As chaos ensues, the humans must confront both the aggressive dinosaurs and their fellow humans to survive the deadly island and expose InGen's plans to the world.</p>
